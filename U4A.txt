As a boy, Robert Ballard liked to read about shipwrecks. He read a lot about the Titanic. "My lifelong dream was to find this great ship," he says.

On August 31, 1985, Ballard's dream came true. He found the wreck of  the Titanic. The ship was in  two main  parts, lying four kilometers  under the sea.  Using video cameras and an undersea  robot, Ballard  looked  around the ship. He  found  many items that told the sad story of the Titanic’s end. For example, he found a child’s shoes, a reminder of the many deaths that happened that night in 1912.

In 1986, Ballard visited the Titanic again. This time, he reached the ship in a small submarine. A deep-sea robot took photos inside the ship. When other people saw the photos, they wanted to visit the ship, too.

When Ballard returned in 2004, he found the Titanic in very bad condition. Other explorers had taken away about 6000 items, like clothes, dishes, and shoes. Some even took pieces of the ship. They think these things should be moved to a safer place, but Ballard doesn't agree.

Ballard believes that taking things from the Titanic is wrong. Instead, he wants to put lights and cameras on and around the shipwreck. This way, people can see the great ship and remember what happened to it. "As long as she needs protection," says Ballard, "the Titanic will always be part of my life."
