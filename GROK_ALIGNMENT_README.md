# Grok AI-Powered Alignment - Complete Solution

This document provides an overview of the Grok-based alignment solution that uses xAI's **Grok-4-fast** model with **structured outputs** (Pydantic schemas) to align canonical text with transcription timestamps using advanced natural language understanding.

## 🎯 What Problem Does This Solve?

Traditional fuzzy matching alignment (used in `pipeline/alignment.py`) can struggle with:
- Paraphrased text
- Different wording or phrasing
- Punctuation and formatting differences
- Contractions vs. expansions (e.g., "don't" vs. "do not")
- Complex sentence structures

**Grok AI alignment** uses natural language understanding to better handle these cases by understanding the *meaning* and *context* of sentences, not just their exact text.

## 📦 What's Included

### Core Module
- **`pipeline/grok_alignment.py`**: Main alignment engine using Grok-4-fast API
  - **Structured outputs** with Pydantic schemas for type-safe responses
  - Parallel processing support (default: 5 workers)
  - Automatic retries with exponential backoff
  - Confidence scoring (0.0-1.0)
  - Comprehensive error handling
  - Data validation (timestamps must be positive integers)

### Demo & Testing Scripts
- **`demo_grok_alignment.py`**: Quick demo showing Grok alignment in action
- **`compare_alignment_methods.py`**: Side-by-side comparison of fuzzy vs. Grok
- **`setup_grok.py`**: Interactive setup wizard for API key configuration

### Documentation
- **`GROK_ALIGNMENT_GUIDE.md`**: Comprehensive usage guide
- **`GROK_ALIGNMENT_README.md`**: This file - overview and quick start

### Dependencies
- Updated **`requirements.txt`**: Now includes `openai>=1.0.0`

## 🚀 Quick Start (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This installs the OpenAI library needed for Grok API access.

### Step 2: Set Up API Key

**Option A: Interactive Setup (Recommended)**
```bash
python setup_grok.py
```
This will guide you through getting and configuring your xAI API key.

**Option B: Manual Setup**
1. Get API key from [https://console.x.ai/](https://console.x.ai/)
2. Set environment variable:
   ```bash
   # Linux/Mac
   export XAI_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'
   
   # Windows PowerShell
   $env:XAI_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'
   ```

### Step 3: Run Demo

```bash
python demo_grok_alignment.py
```

This will align the sample data (U4A.txt + U4A.json) using Grok and show results.

## 📊 How It Works

### Architecture

```
Canonical Text → Sentences → Grok API (parallel) → Aligned Timestamps
                              ↓
                    Transcription JSON (words with timestamps)
```

### Process Flow

1. **Input**: Canonical text sentences + Transcription with word timestamps
2. **Prompt Construction**: Each sentence + full transcription → JSON prompt
3. **Grok Processing**: AI analyzes and finds matching timestamps
4. **Parallel Execution**: Multiple sentences processed simultaneously (default: 5 workers)
5. **Output**: Start/end timestamps for each sentence + confidence scores

### Example

**Input Sentence:**
```
"The ship was in two main parts, lying four kilometers under the sea."
```

**Transcription Excerpt:**
```json
[
  {"text": "The", "start": 22320, "end": 22600},
  {"text": "ship", "start": 22600, "end": 22960},
  ...
  {"text": "sea.", "start": 26760, "end": 27120}
]
```

**Grok Output:**
```json
{
  "start_ms": 22320,
  "end_ms": 27120,
  "confidence": 0.98
}
```

## 🔧 Integration with Existing Pipeline

### Option 1: Replace Fuzzy Matching

In your existing code, replace:

```python
# OLD
from pipeline.alignment import align_sentences_to_words
spans, report = align_sentences_to_words(sentences, words)
```

With:

```python
# NEW
from pipeline.grok_alignment import align_sentences_with_grok
spans, report = align_sentences_with_grok(sentences, words)
```

### Option 2: Hybrid Approach (Best Practice)

Use Grok first, fall back to fuzzy matching for failures:

```python
from pipeline.grok_alignment import align_sentences_with_grok
from pipeline.alignment import align_sentences_to_words

# Try Grok
grok_spans, grok_report = align_sentences_with_grok(sentences, words)

# Find failures
failed_indices = [i for i, span in enumerate(grok_spans) if span is None]

# Fall back to fuzzy matching for failures
if failed_indices:
    fuzzy_sentences = [sentences[i] for i in failed_indices]
    fuzzy_spans, _ = align_sentences_to_words(fuzzy_sentences, words)
    
    # Merge results
    final_spans = grok_spans.copy()
    for i, fuzzy_idx in enumerate(failed_indices):
        final_spans[fuzzy_idx] = fuzzy_spans[i]
```

## 📈 Performance Comparison

## 🧪 Testing

### Test with Sample Data

```bash
# Demo with U4A sample
python demo_grok_alignment.py

# Compare methods
python compare_alignment_methods.py
```

### Test with Your Data

```python
from pipeline.grok_alignment import align_sentences_with_grok
from pipeline.segmentation import segment_sentences
import json

# Load your transcription
with open('your_transcription.json') as f:
    words = json.load(f)['words']

# Load your canonical text
with open('your_text.txt') as f:
    text = f.read()

# Segment and align
sentences = segment_sentences(text)
spans, report = align_sentences_with_grok(sentences, words)

# Check results
print(f"Aligned: {report['global']['aligned']}/{len(sentences)}")
```

## 💰 Cost Considerations

### Pricing (as of current rates)
- Grok-4-fast: ~$0.001 per 1K tokens
- Average sentence + context: ~200-300 tokens
- **Cost per sentence**: ~$0.0002-0.0003

### Example Costs
- 20 sentences: ~$0.006
- 100 sentences: ~$0.03
- 1000 sentences: ~$0.30

### Cost Optimization Tips
1. **Cache results**: Save alignment results to avoid re-processing
2. **Batch processing**: Process multiple files together
3. **Hybrid approach**: Use fuzzy matching first, Grok for failures only
4. **Worker tuning**: Optimize parallel workers for your rate limits

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Problem**: "XAI_API_KEY not set"
```bash
# Solution: Run setup
python setup_grok.py
```

**Problem**: "Rate limit exceeded"
```python
# Solution: Reduce workers
config.max_workers = 2
```

**Problem**: "Connection timeout"
```python
# Solution: Increase timeout
config.timeout = 60
```

**Problem**: Low confidence scores
```python
# Solution: Review text differences
# May need manual review or fuzzy fallback
```
